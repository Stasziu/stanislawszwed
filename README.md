Hello, I'm @stanislawszwed <br>
Currently, at work, I help other people with computer problems. I've always wanted to find out what it's like to work as a Service Desk agent, help other people, and I honestly don't regret it.
Some of my hobbies:
- ðŸ›¹ Skateboarding
- ðŸ§  Creating html pages (yes, this is my hobby)
- ðŸŽ¬ Watching movies, series and reading book covers.

Currently I will try to upload my projects.

If you want to contact me, I encourage you to use <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanis%C5%82aw-szwed-6055521b4/">Linkedin</a> or through the page on <a href="https://facebook.com/stanislawszwed">Facebook</a>
